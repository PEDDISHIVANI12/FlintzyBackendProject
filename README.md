# FlintzyBackendProject
A Spring Boot–based Social Media Management Backend that allows users to securely log in using Google Sign-In, connect their Facebook Pages via the Facebook Graph API, and publish posts directly from the backend to Facebook. All APIs are protected using JWT authentication, and MySQL is used as the persistent data store.
